# space-capsule

This is Sam Patrick Kavanagh's project deployed to a small web server that was launched in a rocket in 2019 as part of an event by the company StackBlitz. It is currently orbitting Earth. Unfortunately Space Internet access is expensive. But if you're an alien passing by, be sure to connect to the rocket's public Wi-Fi hotspot.
